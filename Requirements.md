## Technologies

### Serverside
* NodeJS V4.2

* Keystone JS
* Jade
* Mongo

### Clientside
* SASS
* Foundation Flex Grid v6.0.6
* React v0.14.5
* Animate.css
* Waypoints (vanilla JS)

## CMS
The site is to use keystoneJS where required for updating certain content.
The idea is to use the CMS to enable various Kats to update page content where there either constantly changing content, or constantly added content.
For content that we want more control for interactions or design, but not often updated, then the CMS does not need to be incorporated.

### Non-CMS controlled content
Home page
Case Studies

### CMS controlled content
Blogs

## Phases
The website will be delivered in phases, so the design of the site may change between phase rollouts.

### Phase 1
* Homepage
* Contact Us *
* Jobs *
* Case Studies

Estimated go live date - End of Jan 2016

### Phase 2
Deliverables not set

\* These aspects will be brought over from the existing site, and will be incorporated in a very simplistic manner.
They will be updated in a later phase.
